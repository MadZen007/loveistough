                <div class="about-content">
                    <p class="about-intro">Normally, this section is written in the third person, to sound more "professional", but I want this to really feel like a conversation between close friends. These are topics and ideas that are too personal to be treated any other way.</p>
                    
                    <p>At 52 years old, I can honestly say I've lived through a full spectrum of relationships. The traditional, monogamous marriage, swinging, open relationships, couples, throuples, and even 6 people all dating each other equally together. To do this, has required me to explore many different perspectives, and forced me to be truly honest with myself about what I want, verses what I was always told I "should" want.</p>

                    <p>Being raised by a prison shrink and a former cop in a religious household that was filled with it's own conflicts and hardships, well...it gave me a unique way of looking at people and how to spot the flaws in how we all think and treat each other.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've held corporate leadership jobs most of my life, but have also veered off the usual path to explore things like tattooing, art businesses, "how-to" sex party instructor and even dabbled in porn and designing and building custom sex furniture.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's no correct path, there are just ones that bring you contentment and those that don't.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, I've helped countless couples and single friends clear their minds of the societal clutter, to find focus. Using a mix of psychology, humor, logic and love that allows them to see what questions truly matter at the end of the day.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've learned from painful failures as much as I have from unexpected successes. The entire time I've had a few repeating mental roadblocks, and social myths that I want to share with you. Once you recognize them, and honestly examine them...THEN you can start to find what will truly make you happy.</p>
